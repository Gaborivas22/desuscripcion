I don't know, I just think it's funny

How people associate, like, how you act

With who you are

You know what I'm saying?

If people say you loud as hell

They are making it assume you have friends

They are making it assume everything's going good for you

But it's like, you don't even know

Everyone has different things, you don't even know
